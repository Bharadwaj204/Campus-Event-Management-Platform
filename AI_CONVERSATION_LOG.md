   - Multi-tenant architecture considerations
   - Scalability patterns for 50 colleges × 500 students × 20 events
   - Data isolation strategies

2. **Key Entities and Relationships**
   - Core entities: Users, Events, Registrations, Attendance, Feedback
   - Relationship cardinalities and constraints
   - Data normalization vs denormalization trade-offs

3. **API Design Patterns**
   - RESTful API structure
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Error handling and validation

4. **Reporting Requirements Analysis**
   - Performance considerations for reporting queries

   - Real-time vs batch reporting

### AI Suggestions Followed:
- Multi-tenant database design with college_id as partitioning key
- Event ID uniqueness within college scope
- Separate tables for different event types for better querying
- Indexing strategy for performance

### AI Suggestions Deviated From:
- Initially suggested MongoDB for flexibility, but chose PostgreSQL for ACID compliance
- AI suggested microservices, but implemented as monolith for simplicity
- AI recommended Redis for caching, but kept simple for prototype

### Key Decisions Made:
1. **Database**: PostgreSQL for ACID compliance and complex queries
2. **Backend**: Node.js with Express for rapid prototyping
3. **Frontend**: React for admin portal, React Native for mobile app
4. **Architecture**: Multi-tenant with college-based data isolation
5. **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based access control

### Assumptions Documented:
- Each college operates independently
- Students can only register for events at their own college
- Events have capacity limits
- Attendance is marked on event day
- Feedback is optional but encouraged
- System handles ~25,000 students and ~1,000 events per semester

## Detailed AI Brainstorming Sessions

### Session 1: Database Architecture Discussion

**AI Question**: "What's the best approach for handling multi-tenancy in a campus event management system?"

**AI Suggestions**:
1. **Database-per-tenant**: Separate database for each college
2. **Schema-per-tenant**: Separate schema within same database
3. **Shared database with tenant_id**: Single database with tenant isolation

**My Decision**: Chose shared database with college_id for better resource utilization and easier maintenance.

**Reasoning**: 
- 50 colleges don't justify separate databases
- Shared database allows for cross-college analytics
- Easier backup and maintenance
- Better resource utilization

**AI Follow-up**: "How will you handle data isolation and security?"

**My Implementation**:
- All queries filtered by college_id
- Middleware enforces college-based access
- JWT tokens include college_id
- Database constraints prevent cross-college access

### Session 2: API Design Patterns

**AI Question**: "What's the best way to structure RESTful APIs for event management?"

**AI Suggestions**:
1. **Resource-based URLs**: `/api/events`, `/api/registrations`
2. **Action-based URLs**: `/api/events/register`, `/api/events/checkin`
3. **Nested resources**: `/api/events/:id/registrations`

**My Decision**: Hybrid approach with resource-based primary URLs and action-based endpoints for specific operations.

**Implementation**:
```
GET    /api/events                    # List events
POST   /api/events                    # Create event
GET    /api/events/:id                # Get event details
POST   /api/student/events/:id/register    # Register for event
POST   /api/attendance/events/:id/checkin  # Check in
```

**AI Feedback**: "Good approach! This provides clear resource hierarchy while allowing specific actions."

### Session 3: Reporting System Design

**AI Question**: "How should we design the reporting system for scalability?"

**AI Suggestions**:
1. **Real-time reports**: Generate on-demand
2. **Pre-computed reports**: Store aggregated data
3. **Hybrid approach**: Cache frequently accessed reports

**My Decision**: Real-time reports with intelligent caching.

**Reasoning**:
- Prototype needs to be simple
- Real-time ensures data accuracy
- Can add caching later for production
- SQLite handles current scale well

**AI Follow-up**: "What about report performance with large datasets?"

**My Implementation**:
- Proper database indexing
- Pagination for large result sets
- Filtering to reduce data volume
- Optimized SQL queries with JOINs

### Session 4: Frontend Technology Stack

**AI Question**: "What frontend technologies should we use for admin portal and student app?"

**AI Suggestions**:
1. **React + React Native**: Same language, different platforms
2. **Vue.js + Flutter**: Modern frameworks
3. **Vanilla JS + PWA**: Simple, no framework overhead

**My Decision**: Vanilla JavaScript for both platforms.

**Reasoning**:
- Assignment emphasizes simplicity
- Faster development for prototype
- No framework learning curve
- Easier to demonstrate core concepts

**AI Feedback**: "Good choice for a prototype! You can always migrate to frameworks later."

### Session 5: Authentication and Security

**AI Question**: "How should we handle authentication and authorization?"

**AI Suggestions**:
1. **JWT tokens**: Stateless, scalable
2. **Session-based**: Server-side sessions
3. **OAuth integration**: Third-party authentication

**My Decision**: JWT tokens with role-based access control.

**Implementation**:
- JWT tokens with user_id, college_id, and role
- Middleware for authentication and authorization
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Token expiration and refresh

**AI Follow-up**: "What about security best practices?"

**My Implementation**:
- Helmet.js for security headers
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting
- Input validation with Joi
- SQL injection prevention

### Session 6: Database Schema Optimization

**AI Question**: "How should we optimize the database schema for performance?"

**AI Suggestions**:
1. **Normalized design**: Reduce redundancy
2. **Denormalized design**: Faster queries
3. **Hybrid approach**: Normalize core data, denormalize for reports

**My Decision**: Normalized design with strategic denormalization for reports.

**Implementation**:
- Normalized tables for data integrity
- Views for complex report queries
- Proper indexing strategy
- Foreign key constraints

**AI Feedback**: "Excellent! This balances data integrity with query performance."

### Session 7: Error Handling and Validation

**AI Question**: "How should we handle errors and validate input data?"

**AI Suggestions**:
1. **Centralized error handling**: Global error middleware
2. **Input validation**: Joi schema validation
3. **Custom error classes**: Structured error responses

**My Decision**: All three approaches combined.

**Implementation**:
- Global error handling middleware
- Joi validation for all inputs
- Custom error classes for different error types
- Consistent error response format

### Session 8: Testing Strategy

**AI Question**: "What testing approach should we use for the API?"

**AI Suggestions**:
1. **Unit tests**: Test individual functions
