# 🎉 Campus Event Management System  

Hi! This is my project for **Webknot Technologies Campus Drive**.  
It’s 100% finished ✅ and ready to submit.  

This project is like an **all-in-one app for college events**.

- Works for **many colleges** at the same time

## 🛠 Tech Used
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL  
- **Auth**: JWT (login system)  
- **Frontend**: Simple HTML, CSS, JavaScript
