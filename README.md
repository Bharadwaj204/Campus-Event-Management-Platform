## ðŸŽ¯ Project Completion Status: 100% âœ…

**Submission Ready for Webknot Technologies Campus Drive Assignment**

All required deliverables have been successfully completed and are ready for submission. This project demonstrates comprehensive full-stack development skills, system design capabilities, and AI-assisted development practices.

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the Webknot Technologies Campus Drive Assignment. The platform consists of:

- **Admin Portal (Web)**: For college staff to create, manage events, and generate reports
- **Student App (Mobile)**: For students to browse, register for events, and provide feedback
- **Backend API**: RESTful API built with Node.js and PostgreSQL
- **Reporting System**: Comprehensive analytics and reporting capabilities

## My Understanding of the Project

After analyzing the requirements and implementing the solution, I understand this project as a multi-tenant event management system that addresses the core needs of educational institutions. The system handles the complete event lifecycle from creation to post-event analysis, with a focus on scalability, user experience, and data-driven insights.

### Key Challenges Addressed:
1. **Multi-tenancy**: Supporting 50+ colleges with isolated data
2. **Scalability**: Handling 25,000+ students and 1,000+ events per semester
3. **Real-time Operations**: Event registration, attendance tracking, and feedback collection
4. **Data Analytics**: Comprehensive reporting for decision-making
5. **User Experience**: Intuitive interfaces for both admins and students

### Technical Decisions Made:
- **PostgreSQL**: Chosen for ACID compliance and complex querying capabilities
- **JWT Authentication**: For secure, stateless authentication
- **RESTful API Design**: For clean, maintainable API structure
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: College-based data isolation for security and performance
- **Comprehensive Indexing**: For optimal query performance at scale

- **Student**: student1@techuniv.edu / student123

## Database Schema

The database follows a normalized design with the following key entities:

- **colleges**: Institution information
- **users**: Students and admins with role-based access
- **event_categories**: Event type classifications
- **events**: Event details and metadata
- **registrations**: Student event registrations
- **attendance**: Check-in/check-out records
- **feedback**: Student ratings and comments

## Scalability Considerations

The system is designed to handle:
- **50 colleges** with independent data isolation
- **500 students per college** (25,000 total)
- **20 events per semester per college** (1,000 total)
- **Concurrent operations** with proper indexing and connection pooling
- **Multi-tenant architecture** for data security and performance

## Deployment

For production deployment:
1. Set up PostgreSQL database
2. Configure environment variables
3. Run database migrations
4. Deploy backend to cloud platform (Heroku, AWS, etc.)
